H.266, or VVC (Versatile Video Coding), is a codec standardized in 2020 by the Joint Video Experts Team (JVET). It succeeds [H.265](../video/HEVC.mdx), and claims to be 40% more efficient. In practice, it is currently about as efficient as [AV1](../video/AV1.mdx) when using the [VVenC](../encoders/VVenC.mdx) encoder, although it is inherently a more complex format which means it will be more difficult to decode. It is encumbered by royalties.
