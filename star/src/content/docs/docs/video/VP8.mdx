VP8 is a video compression format developed by On2 Technologies released in 2008. It was later released as a royalty free codec in 2010 by Google. Its efficiency is competitive with [AVC](../video/AVC.mdx). VP8 was a significant player in the royalty-free codec space and was used in various applications like web video delivery. It is the precursor to [VP9](../video/VP9.mdx) & [AV1](../video/AV1.mdx), which both further improve video compression efficiency. VP8 has faced criticism for having a messy specification that many considered to be incomplete.
