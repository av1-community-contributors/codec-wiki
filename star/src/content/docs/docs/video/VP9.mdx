VP9, famous for being YouTube's codec of choice for many years, is a royalty free video compression format that competes with [HEVC](../video/HEVC.mdx) and [AVC](../video/AVC.mdx). It is slightly less efficient than HEVC in terms of visual quality, but VP9 is a computationally much simpler codec and therefore is very easy on system resources when decoding. If you're interested in VP9 encoding, please see the [vpxenc](../encoders/vpxenc.mdx) or [SVT-VP9](../encoders/SVT-VP9.mdx) sections.
