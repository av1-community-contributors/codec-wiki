## Before You Contribute

1. By contributing to the Codec Wiki, you are communicating that you have read & agreed to our Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policy, & Code of Conduct.
2. Ensure your understanding of the material you're contributing is sufficient to a point where it is useful to the project. It is perfectly acceptable not to get everything right the first time, but always double-check your contributions for factual correctness.

**Our current priority is filling out the existing pages with content. Please assist in doing this, if possible, before considering adding new pages.**

If you're unsure the content in your entry is completely correct or you believe your entry needs review, please attach the following message at the top of your entry:

:::caution[Pending Review]
The content in this entry may not be entirely accurate, & is pending further review to assess the quality of the information.
:::

If you're aware your entry is too short or incomplete, please add the following message to the top of your entry:

:::note[Under Maintenance]
The content in this entry is incomplete & is in the process of being completed.
:::

If you've added a new page & you aren't sure what should go there (this isn't recommended while there are still so many empty pages to be filled), add the following message as your page entry:

:::danger[Help Wanted]
This section is in need of contributions. If you believe you can help, please see our [Contribution Guide](../docs/contribution-guide.mdx) to get started as a contributor!

## Clone & Push Instructions

**Make sure to clone from & edit the** `main` **branch only, & push your final changes to the** `deployment` **branch according to the instructions below. Also be sure to use node 18 LTS, as later versions tend to be troublesome.**

_don't forget to add unimportant files to the .gitignore before making any commits_

1. Clone from the `main` branch to start to make a contribution:

```bash
% git clone git@github.com:av1-community-contributors/av1-wiki.github.io.git -b main
```

2. Test your changes locally before making a commit:

```bash
% yarn
% npx docusaurus start
```

3. Push changes to `main` branch:

```bash
% git add .
% git commit -m "Commit Message"
% git push -u origin main
```

4. Deploy to `deployment` branch to make live on site:

```bash
% GIT_USER=<username> DEPLOYMENT_BRANCH=deployment yarn deploy
```

_Docusaurus Info_

## Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

See the initial instructions at the top.
