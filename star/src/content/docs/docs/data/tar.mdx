tar, or Tape ARchive, is a archiving format and utility first developed for Version 7 Unix in 1977. It's original purpose was to collate files into one that can be stored on tape. Similarly, today it is used to bring many files together into a "tarball", which can be compressed with any general data compression algorithm.

## Usage

:::note
This guide has been written for GNU tar on linux, however it should be applicable to BSD tar, macOS tar, and the tar command in powershell on Windows.

### Create a tar archive

```bash
tar -cf {archive name} {files listed here}
```

You can use `tar` to compress your archive, for example into a `.tar.gz` or `.tar.xz` archive. To do this, you either can either use a flag such as `-z`, `-j`, or `-J` ([gzip](./gzip.mdx), [bzip2](./bzip2.mdx), [xz](../data/xz.mdx)), or you can use `-a` ('automatic'), which allows it to intuit what algorithm you want from the file extension, such as `archive.tar.xz` for an xz compressed tarball.

GNU tar can use these compression algorithms

- gzip (.gz)
- bzip2 (.bz)
- xz (.xz)
- lzip (.lz)
- lzma (.lzma)
- lzop (.lzo)
- zstd (.zstd)

### Extract a tar archive

```bash
tar -xf {tarball}.tar -C {directory to extract to}
```

tar can extract from it's supported compressed formats, such as `archive.tar.xz` automatically, with no extra flags.
