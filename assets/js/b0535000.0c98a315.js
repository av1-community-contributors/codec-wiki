For images, a big use case is web delivery. Compared to other multimedia, images are incredibly popular on the Web & knowing how to serve them properly can be a massive boon to your website's traffic as well as less of a headache for users on slower connections or who are under bandwidth constraints. The most disappointing part is that images are often poorly done on the web; all too frequently will you run into a site serving massive photographic PNGs for no reason, or photography sites serving photographs fresh out of the editing software with no thought put into their final delivery. A little effort, patience, & knowledge will go a long way toward improving the user experience for individuals using your site, & this article will illustrate some of the basics."})}function g(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,a.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,n.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,n.jsx)(u,{...e})}):u(e)}},5488:e=>{e.exports=JSON.parse('{"permalink":"/blog/site-optimization","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-21-site-optimization.mdx","title":"Reducing Image Load Online","description":"A big part of understanding any multimedia codec technology is knowing the application for such technology.
