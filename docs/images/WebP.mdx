WebP is a free image file format first released by Google in 2010. It consists of 2 primary "modes" of operation. A lossy mode derived from the [VP8](../video/VP8.mdx) video codec, and a novel lossless mode added in 2011.

## Encoding

### Using libwebp
libwebp supports WebP, JPEG, PNG, PNM (PGM, PPM, PAM), TIFF as input formats, and a quality (`-q`) value between 0 (lowest quality, smallest file) and 100 (highest quality, largest file). Should you need the lossless mode, you need to instead use a `-z` argument, with values representing the effort used between 0 (fastest encode, largest file) and 9 (slowest encode, smallest file).

```bash
cwebp example.png -q 75 -o example.webp
```

## decoding

```bash
dwebp example.webp -o example.png
```
