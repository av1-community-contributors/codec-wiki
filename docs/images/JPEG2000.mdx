JPEG-2000 is an older image compression format that uses wavelet technology to achieve high compression ratios while maintaining image quality. It supports both lossy and lossless compression, and is commonly used in applications such as digital photography, medical imaging, and video surveillance. JPEG-2000 files can be transparently compressed and decompressed using a variety of software tools and libraries, making it a flexible and widely-supported format for image storage & transmission. JPEG-2000 never effectively took off on the Web, but digital cinema distribution is often done with JPEG-2000. A "DCP" is a "Digital Cinema Package," which is a format used to distribute and play back digital movies in theaters. These DCPs are often compressed losslessly with JPEG-2000.
