:::info Under Maintenance

If you've added a new page & you aren't sure what should go there (this isn't recommended while there are still so many empty pages to be filled), add the following message as your page entry:

## Clone & Push Instructions
**Make sure to clone from & edit the** `main` **branch only, & push your final changes to the** `deployment` **branch according to the instructions below. Also be sure to use node 18 LTS, as later versions tend to be troublesome.**

*don't forget to add unimportant files to the .gitignore before making any commits*

1. Clone from the `main` branch to start to make a contribution:
```bash
% git clone git@github.com:av1-community-contributors/av1-wiki.github.io.git -b main
```

2. Test your changes locally before making a commit:
```bash
% yarn
% yarn start
```

3. Push changes to `main` branch:
```bash
% git add .
% git commit -m "Commit Message"
% git push -u origin main
```

4. Deploy to `deployment` branch to make live on site:
```bash
% GIT_USER=<username> DEPLOYMENT_BRANCH=deployment yarn deploy
```

*Docusaurus Info*
## Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

See the initial instructions at the top.
