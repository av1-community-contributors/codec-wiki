rAV1ator is a fork of [Aviator](../utilities/Aviator.mdx) designed to use [Av1an](../utilities/av1an.mdx) & [rav1e](../encoders/rav1e.mdx) instead of [SVT-AV1](../encoders/SVT-AV1.mdx). It is also distributed as a Flatpak with bundled dependencies outside of Flathub; running the following command will allow you to install it:

```bash
flatpak --user remote-add --no-gpg-verify project-volo https://giannirosato.com/repo && flatpak --user install project-volo net.natesales.rAV1ator
```

Initially, Aviator was supposed to switch to using the Av1an + rav1e backend that currently serves rAV1ator, but the decision was made to split the two projects due to their fundamentally different goals & Flathub's trouble with Rust dependencies. Aviator is designed to allow easy, painless AV1 encoding, while rAV1ator is designed to make accessing *specifically* Av1an & rav1e easier for interested codec enthusiasts. rAV1ator is maintained by Gianni Rosato & Trix.
