[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) is a multimedia framework that has utilities for transcoding, transmuxing, and filtering audio and video. It provides the `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe`, and `ffplay` command-line utilities. It also features the libav\* libraries, which allow you to use the functionality of FFmpeg without the programs.

# Installation

There are a number of ways to install FFmpeg depending on the operating system you're using.

### Linux & macOS

**Package Manager**

The easiest way to obtain FFmpeg is through your package manager. On most package managers, the package is simply named `ffmpeg`, however `ffprobe` and `ffplay` may have their own packages. Note that the packages may be outdated.

**Compiling from source**

A more complete guide is available at the [FFmpeg Compilation Guide](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide). Simplifying things a bit, what you need to do is:
- grab [the sources](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) or clone from FFmpeg's git: `git clone https://git.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git ffmpeg`
- Enter the directory & run `./configure --help` to see a list of features and libraries you can choose to build with.
- Install all libraries you want to build FFmpeg with.
- Run `./configure` with `--enable-` flags as desired.
- Run `make`, or `make -j $(nproc)` on Linux to properly make use of multiple cores. on macOS, this would be `make -j $(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)`.
- Run `make install`. May require root.

### Windows

There are no official binaries for FFmpeg on Windows, but you can download third-party binaries:
- by [gyan.dev](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/)
- by [BtbN](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases)

# Using FFmpeg
`ffmpeg` is the primary command-line tool of FFmpeg. It takes 0 or more files as inputs & outputs.

`ffmpeg`'s command-line arguments are positional, meaning it matters where you put each option. Each input and output has its own arguments. For example, `ffmpeg -r 24 -i file1 file2` applies the `-r 24` option to the input `file1`, interpreting the video as having that frame rate, while `ffmpeg -i file1 -r 24 file2` applies the `-r 24` option to `file2`. To get a list of options, refer to the more verbose [FFmpeg documentation](//ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-all.html).

#### Transcode a video

```bash
ffmpeg -i [input] -c:v [video_codec] -b:v [video_bitrate] -c:a [audio_codec] -b:a [audio_bitrate] output
```

| Option               | Meaning                                                     |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-c:v video_encoder` | **c**odec for the automatically selected **v**ideo stream   |
| `-b:v video_bitrate` | **b**itrate for the automatically selected **v**ideo stream |
| `-c:a audio_encoder` | **c**odec for the automatically selected **a**udio stream   |
| `-b:a audio_bitrate` | **b**itrate for the automatically selected **a**udio stream |

#### Transmux a video

```bash
ffmpeg -i [input] -c copy [output]
```

| Option    | Meaning                       |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| `-c copy` | set the **c**odec to **copy** |

#### Filter a video

```bash
ffmpeg -i [input] -c:v [video_encoder] -c:a [audio_codec] (...) -vf [filter_name] output
```

| Option            | Meaning                                         |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `-vf filter_name` | set the **v**ideo **f**ilter to **filter_name** |

#### Container selection

FFmpeg will usually select the appropriate container based on the file extension of the output. If it doesn't detect the correct container, you can specify it with `-f`.

| Option           | Meaning                               |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `-f format_name` | set the **f**ormat to **format_name** |
