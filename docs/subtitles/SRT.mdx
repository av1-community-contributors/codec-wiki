# SRT

SubRip Text (SRT) is a text format for subtitles, described as 'the most basic of all subtitle formats'. SRT files are plain text with the extension `.srt`.

## Format
Subtitles are placed into sequentially ordered groups, called cues, with a starting and ending timestamp, encoded `hours:minutes:seconds,milliseconds`. Note the seperator for the millisecond value is a comma. The starting and ending value are seperated by ` --> `.
### Unoffical features
Some basic HTML tags are supported by some viewers, such as:
* `<b>bold</b>` **bold**
* `<i>italics</i>` *italics*
* `<u></u>` underlined
* `<font color="#0000FF">Blue</font>` colored text.

Note these will be displayed verbatim on viewers that don't support these features.
## Example
```
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This subtitle will be visible for the first minute of the stream

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and this one for thirty seconds after that.
```
