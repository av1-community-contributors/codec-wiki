AV1 is a royalty-free video compression format designed to succeed [VP9](../video/VP9.mdx). It presently competes with [VP9](../video/VP9.mdx), [VVC](../video/VVC.mdx), and [HEVC](../video/HEVC.mdx). AV1 is computationally more complex than VP9, but is fast to decode due to the mature and efficient dav1d AV1 decoder. AV1 hardware accelerated decoding is also available on a variety of different consumer hardware devices, all of which are enumerated [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV1#Hardware). Standout entries include modern Intel, AMD, & Nvidia integrated & discrete GPUs, Google's Tensor SoC powering the Pixel line, Apple's A17 Pro in the iPhone 15 Pro series, and modern Mediatek & Qualcomm chips. YouTube is currently in the process of transitioning their videos to use AV1.

There are a number of viable AV1 encoding solutions available today. The three best, most ubiquitous, and free implementations are [aomenc](../encoders/aomenc.mdx), [SVT-AV1](../encoders/SVT-AV1.mdx), & [rav1e](../encoders/rav1e.mdx).

### Codec String

You may come across a codec string like
```
av01.0.09M.08
```
Let's break it down

So the above example is an AV1 video with a main profile, level 4.1, 8-bit depth, and main tier.
Taken from a YouTube 1080p av1 video.

It might also contain additional information like (in order of appearance):
- a monochrome flag
- chroma subsampling
- color primaries
- transfer characteristics
- matrix coefficients
- color range

But those are much rarer to come by.
