H.265, also known as High-Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), is a video compression standard designed to deliver higher-quality videos with reduced file sizes. It is a successor to the [H.264](../video/AVC.mdx) codec and was developed to address the increasing demand for efficient and high-quality video compression, particularly in the context of 4K content. This codec is encumbered by royalties.
