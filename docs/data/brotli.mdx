Brotli was released by Google in late 2013, & it is commonly used on the Web for content delivery. It is a core part of the `.woff2` Web Open Font Format, allowing web fonts to be smaller when sent to users as part of a website. It is not very common to pass around `.tar.br` Brotli archives like you would with [gzip](../data/gzip.mdx) or [xz](../data/xz.mdx), so it is perfectly acceptable that such files aren't really compatible anywhere. Brotli is almost universally compatible across the Web, supported by as much as 96% of the World Wide Web's users.

Brotli is based on LZ77 & Huffman coding, much like ZIP. It also uses context modeling to allow the use of multiple Huffman trees for the same alphabet in the same block; this essentially means that based on the context of the data being compressed, it can be compressed more efficiently especially if it contains multiple different kinds of data.

Brotli was co-authored & partially developed by Jyrki Alakuijala, who also worked on [JPEG-XL](../images/JXL.mdx) & the efficient [JPEG](../images/JPEG.mdx) encoder jpegli. JPEG-XL's metadata information is usually Brotli-compressed.
