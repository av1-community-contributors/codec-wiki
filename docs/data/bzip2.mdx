:::

bzip2 is a open source file compression format and utility. It's efficency is slightly better than [zip](./zip.mdx), but worse than lzma based formats like [xz](./xz.mdx) and [7z](./7z.mdx). bzip2 cannot be used to compress mutliple files at once, you should collate files together into a [tarball](./tar.mdx) to compress mutliple files using bzip2.
