# x265

x265 is a software library and command line application for encoding [H.265 / HEVC](../video/HEVC.mdx) developed by MulticoreWare, written in C++ and x86 assembly, and released in 2013.

By default, x265 is tuned for medium to high quality encodes at FHD+ resolutions and can be tuned for high fidelity and micro encodes easily.

x265 is currently not recommended for lossless encoding. For that niche, x264 is considerably faster without meaningful efficiency loss.

# FFmpeg

x265 is available in FFmpeg via `libx265`, to check if you have it, run `ffmpeg -h encoder=libx265`.

# Installation

**Pre-built binary (Recommended):**

- http://msystem.waw.pl/x265/

# Parameters

This section will overview the most important parameters for controlling output and quality in x265. The parameters will be listed in the format used by the standalone x265 binary,
but all of the parameters should also be usable in ffmpeg in the format e.g. `-x265-params pass=1`.

## Preset

`--preset`

In x265 we have a preset system to easily control how much effort and therefore time x265 puts into compressing your video. This preset system has the following presets.

ultrafast, superfast, faster, fast, medium (default), slow, slower, veryslow and placebo

Generally speaking the further left of medium the preset is the faster and therefore less efficient the encode is and the opposite is true for the right side.

It is recommended to pick the slowest preset you can bare to use on your hardware before messing with any of the following settings on this page as this will be your baseline for encoder performance.

It is not recommended to use the two extremes as ultrafast is terrible in its consistency and you're better off using something like x264. placebo on the other hand performs slightly worse than
veryslow for reasons that will be explained later.

## CRF

`--crf`

CRF or Constant Rate Factor is the closest thing in x265 to a quality slider for the final encode where a smaller value is higher quality and a larger value is lower quality.
While CRF is a good overall consistency, the exact quality you get at a specific CRF does still vary by source although not as much as other methods. while the quality at a given CRF is generally
similar with the same settings, changing specific settings (like psy-rd) or the preset you're using can change the quality at a given CRF. Usually the slower the preset the higher the quality given a CRF.

Below is a list of rough CRF values to experiment with when targeting a specific quality. This is only rough as it is source and setting dependant as explained earlier.

| Quality          	| 720 	| 1080 	| 4k 	|
|----------------	|-----	|------	|----	|
| Transparent    	| 14  	| 16   	| 18 	|
| High Quality   	| 18  	| 22   	| 24 	|
| Medium Quality 	| 24  	| 26   	| 28 	|
| Low Quality    	| 28  	| 30   	| 32 	|

While not always consistent, x265 aims for a increase of 6 CRF or a decrease of 6 CRF to be a half or doubling of file size respectively. 

CRF is also preferable to other rate control methods due to its consistency in quality and being the most efficient mode of them all.

## B-frames

`--bframes`, `--b-adapt`, `--bframe-bias` and `--b-pyramid`

B-frames are bi-directional predictive frames. This means they can reference either past, future or both types of frames at the same time making them one of the most efficient types. B-frames
however usually are the most compressed frame types. Referencing other frames rather than storing their own detail (usually.) makes them often the worse quality and blurry frames. In total we
have 4 different settings to control how they are used by the encoder. Usually you will never touch these.

### `--bframes`

`--bframes` is used to control the max number of consecutive B-frames the encoder is allowed to use and search for. Generally the larger this value is to a max of `16` the slower but more
efficient the encoder becomes. However in higher fidelity encodes around crf 18 or lower, beyond 8-12 B-frames can start to hurt detail for the reasons stated above. Likewise the benefits of
more B-frames vs the time it takes makes it not typically worth it beyond a similar point.

In general it is best to leave this setting at the default for your preset. However for content like anime or otherwise flat non IRL adding +2 B-frames to the current preset generally gives a
small efficiency boost. You can also set it to the max value of 16 for micro encodes to try and squeeze the most efficient possible out of the encoder if time is no object to you.

### `--b-adapt`

`--b-adapt` controls the method that the encoder uses to decide where to put B-frames. It has 3 different modes.
| mode   | feature                    |
|--------|----------------------------|
| 1      | Fixed                      |
| 2      | Light lookahead            |
| 3      | Viterbi trellis (default)  |


It is always recommended to use 3 as it comes at a negligible speed penalty and is the smartest at placing B-frames for maximum efficiency without harming visual fidelity.

### `--bframe-bias`

`--bframe-bias` as the name implies is used to control the bias for x265 to use B-frames over other frame types. Normally you should never touch this setting as the default of `0` is already
optimal for most cases, however for high fidelity encodes or micro encodes adjusting this bias can help retain detail or sacrifice spacial detail for better temporal information.

### `--b-pyramid`

`--b-pyramid` or `--no-b-pyramid` decides if B-frames can be used as reference frames for other B-frames or other frame types. Normally this should always be on and is the default. However for
high fidelity encodes it might be worth wild experimenting with turning it off only in limited use cases.

## SAO

`--sao`, `--limit-sao`, `--no-sao`

SAO or Sample Adaptive Offset is a restoration filter in h.265 used to prevent obvious blocking and ringing artifacts especially around sharp edges.
However this does sometimes come at the cost of some finer details in the video like for example human skin and surface details.
Generally speaking at crf values at or above 20 you can leave this option on which is default as it does a good job of making the overall video more appealing.

x265 however has a primitive implementation of SAO which tends to be too aggressive at high quality or fidelity ranges leading to blurring around crf 19-16.
while it does "limit" how much the encoder uses SAO, `--limit-sao` is more of an early termination for the encoder deciding where to use it rather than limiting its strength.
However it does generally do a good job of preserving more detail than normal even if it makes some artifacts more noticeable.

For below crf 16 depending on your content it might be preferable to outright disable sao with `--no-sao` as usually at such high quality its not usually needed.

## Deblock

`--deblock`

Word of caution i dont know who wrote this part and the documentation around the deblock setting is esoteric.

Deblock is another loop filter, this one intended to reduce blocking in videos, but may have a blurring effect at high strengths. For most encodes, it is fine to leave this
at the default value. At lower CRF values, it may be desirable to lower this to `--deblock -1:-1` for anime or `--deblock -2:-2` for live action, in order to preserve
more grain and detail.

## Psy-RD

`--psy-rd` and `--psy-rdoq`

To make a long story short `--psy-rd` and `--psy-rdoq` together are psychovisual optimization tools used to control the encoders willingness to retain finer detail and noise in the
final encode. However the way the two settings achieve this are very different.

`--psy-rd` retains detail by affecting the how the encoder weights sections of the frame based off the amount of "energy" or high frequency information it contains and boosts them
accordingly.

`--psy-rdoq` retains detail by affecting how the encoder quantizes coefficients after transformations. It has no reference to the source in its calculation and only prefers retaining overall visual
energy and nothing specific.

Both settings are highly source dependent and ideally would be tweaked per scene in a video. Unless you know what you're doing and are willing to test thoroughly that the settings you
are using are beneficial its almost always recommended to never touch either setting as the defaults for both are good general purpose settings.
However as a general rule of thumb `--psy-rd` is better at retaining specific detail and overall sharpness while `--psy-rdoq` is better at retaining overall noise.

You can read more about the importance of perceptual optimization in video encoders on the [psychovisual](../introduction/psychovisual.mdx) page.

## Adaptive Quantization

`--aq-mode` and `--aq-strength`

Adaptive quantization (`--aq-mode`), shortened to AQ, is a mechanism to redistribute bitrate within a frame to improve perceptual quality consistency.
In x265 we have 4 modes.
| mode | feature                                      |
|------|----------------------------------------------|
| 1    | AQ enabled                                   |
| 2    | AQ with auto variance (default)              |
| 3    | AQ 2 with a bias for dark scenes             |
| 4    | AQ 2 with edge information                   |


Generally speaking we always want AQ 2 or AQ with auto variance as this will bias both parts of the frame that are smooth and textured. Normally these parts of the frame are bitrate starved
and have the most noticeable artifacting.

Some people will use AQ 3 to as the name implies preserve detail in dark scenes and parts of the frame. However in metric analysis and some visual, AQ 3 sometimes bloats bitrates for minor to
no gains. While this is not an entirely useless AQ mode, thorough testing should be done before using it.

The relative strength of an AQ mode can also be controlled with `--aq-strength`. While the default is `1.0`, many people do lower it to `0.7` or `0.8` for flat anime or compressed irl content.
In general like other psychovisual optimization tools in x265, these settings are highly source dependant and are best left at their defaults unless you know what you are doing and have data
to back it up.

## CU-Tree

`--cutree` and `--no-cutree`

CU-Tree similar to MB-Tree in x264 is a method for the encoder to keep track of what parts of the frame are used or referenced by future frames. In a sense this is temporal motion quantizer.
It has been very common for a long time all the way back when only x264 existed for people to disable MB-Tree due to the idea that it removed too much detail or blurred the video. However
a lot of that blur and detail loss was in parts of the frame temporally one would not be able to see very well or were not still making the overall images better in playback. Both MB-Tree and
CU-tree have also gotten a lot better since their original implementation making it almost always worse to disable them rather than to keep them enabled.

Anyone telling you to disable either must provide evidence of it being actually better.
