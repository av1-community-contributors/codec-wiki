# Aurora1 AV1

Aurora1 AV1 is a proprietary software AV1 encoder developed by [Visionular](https://www.visionular.com/en). Not much is known about this encoder other than rumors that it is supposedly "better" than public, FOSS encoders. With some pretty dubious claims and proof provided by the company themselves.
