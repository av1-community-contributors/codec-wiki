# Video Players

Many different players exist for video, but here are a few recommended ones:

## MPV

**MPV** is a open source lightweight media player. It is intended as a command-line application, making it's user interface extremely minimal, however, many frontends exist for mpv, giving a more complete GUI, such as Celluloid and IINA. It has wide codec and container support.

## VLC

**VLC** is an open source media player and toolkit. It supports almost all video and audio codecs in common use.


Download instructions for VLC on all relevant platforms can be found at [VideoLAN's website](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/#download)


## MPC-HC

**Media Player Classic - Home Cinema (MPC-HC)** is an open source media player designed exclusively for Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10, 11 operating systems. Recognized for its simplicity and efficiency, MPC-HC provides users with a streamlined and user-friendly platform for playing a diverse range of audio and video file formats. Its lightweight design ensures smooth playback without taxing system resources. While the official development ceased in 2017, the community-driven MPC-HC on GitHub continues to provide updates and support.

The latest un/stable builds of MPC-HC, maintained by the community, can be found on [clsid2's MPC-HC repository](https://github.com/clsid2/mpc-hc/releases).
